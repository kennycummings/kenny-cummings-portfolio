Kenny Cummings Professional Work Portfolio
<br>
<br>
The goal of this is to create a professional work portfolio to showcase to potential employers. 
I have a wide variety of experience in ecommerce and marketing. I recently pivoted to web development. 
I am learning a great deal of HTML and CSS in the process.
The end product is a simple, clean, and aesthetic website.
I decided to go with a dark blue background for my header and footer with white font to compliment them.
This helps my project pop without being too busy.
I played with negative space by switching the image and text positions with every other row.
The header links scroll down to their appropriate sections instantaneously.
I decided to use my resume bullet points and displayed them using "ul" and "li" tags under my work experience sctions.
I played with the footer for a while to get the alignment of each either far left or far right. I did this using "style" in HTML.
On a second passthrough, I added two sections: about me and a list of web development projects, with appropriate linking.
