Kenny Cummings Professional Work Portfolio
<br>
<br>
The goal of this is to create a professional work portfolio to showcase to potential employers. 
I have a wide variety of experience in ecommerce and marketing. I recently pivoted to web development.
<br>
I am learning a great deal of HTML and CSS in the process.
<br>
The end product is a simple, clean, and aesthetic website.
<br>
I decided to go with a dark blue background for my header and footer with white font to compliment them.
This helps my project pop without being too busy.
<br>
I played with negative space by switching the image and text positions of my experience at room service 360.
<br>
The header links scroll down to Web Content and Development and Copywriting and Blogging bodies instantaneously.
<br>
I decided to use my resume bullet points and displayed them using "ul" and "li" tags.
<br>
I played with the footer for a while to get the alignment of each either far left or far right. I did this using "style" in HTML.
